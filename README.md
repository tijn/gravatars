# Important - This add-on is outdated

I recently tried to revive this add-on because it doesn't work with the current version of Thunderbird, but sadly, 
because the internal API's of Thunderbird changed there is no way for me to show a picture in the message list anymore. 
This basically means that this add-on is dead/outdated/an historical artefact, 
and that the only way to get its behaviour back is by patching Thunderbird itself. 

Please do tell me if I am wrong. 
Please point me to the correct API methods and I promise to give it a try.
